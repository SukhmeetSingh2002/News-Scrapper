BARUIPUR: Two Trinamool Congress-turned-BJP leaders, Suvendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee, led a blistering attack on the Mamata Banerjee government in the Trinamool fort in South 24 Parganas after some party supporters greeted them with black flags on the way to the public meeting, reports Monotosh Chakraborty. At the event, MLA Dipak Haldar and Trinamool block president Bhaktaram Mandal joined BJP in presence of Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh and party national vice-president Mukul Roy. While Suvendu targeted Mamata and her nephew Abhishek, Rajib listed development dreams for Bengal, saying home minister Amit Shah had assured him of a special economic package for the state once BJP took office in the state.
