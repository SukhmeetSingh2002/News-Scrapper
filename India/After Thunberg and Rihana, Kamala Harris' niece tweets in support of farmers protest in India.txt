"Itâs no coincidence that the worldâs oldest democracy was attacked not even a month ago, and as we speak, the most populous democracy is under assault. This is related. We ALL should be outraged by Indiaâs internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters," Harris tweeted as she tagged a photograph of group of farmers protesting against the farm laws. Drawing parallels between the the storming of the US Capitol and the crackdown on the protesting farmers, Harris said "militant nationalism is just as potent a force in US politics as it is in India or any place else." Recently, a couple of other international personalities have come out in support of the protesting farmers in India, including singer Rihana and environment activist Greta Thunberg. "We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India," Thunberg wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. The teen activist's post on the micro-blogging site came after Rihanna shared a news article highlighting the Centre's crackdown on the farmers by cutting off internet services in many regions. "Why aren't we talking about this?!", wrote Rihanna, as she added the hashtag #FarmersProtest along with the post on the micro-blogging site.
