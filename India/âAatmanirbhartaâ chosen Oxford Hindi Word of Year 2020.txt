LONDON: âAatmanirbhartaâ, implying self-reliance, has been chosen by Oxford Languages, which publishes the Oxford English dictionary, as its Hindi Word of Year 2020 as it âvalidated the day-to-day achievements of the countless Indians who dealt with and survived the perils of a pandemicâ. Explaining the choice, Kritika Agrawal, who sits on the advisory panel that selects the Hindi Word of the Year, said: âIn an address to the nation in early May 2020, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Indiaâs Covid-19 recovery package, he emphasised the need of becoming self-reliant as a country, as an economy, as a society, and as individuals, in a bid to navigate the perils of a pandemic. The Prime Minister elaborated on this, noting that Aatmanirbhar Bharat is not about being self-contained or being closed to the world, it is about being self-sustaining and self-generating. We saw a significant increase in the usage of Aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) following the Prime Ministerâs address, highlighting its increased prominence as a phrase and concept in the public lexicon.â The Hindi Word of the Year is a word or expression that is chosen to reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the passing year that have potential to become a lasting term of cultural significance. Agrawal said 2020 had required individual self-reliance more than ever before as millions in India adapted to new ways of living during the pandemic. âFrom home schooling to remote working, from creating our own means of entertainment to finding ways of keeping ourselves physically fit within confined spaces, from cooking for ourselves to caring for ourselves, and being forced to remain away from family and loved ones for extended periods of time, what has got many of us through is self-reliance,â she said. âAs we enter 2021, one of the standout successes of the entire Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign is the large-scale manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccine in India,â she added. In 2019, the Hindi Word of the Year was Samvidhaan or the Constitution owing to the nationwide debates and discussions which followed the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35(A).
