INDORE: Even though Indore civic bodyâs act of dumping homeless elderly people out of the city has caused widespread outrage, the incident has also led to the reunion of a woman with her husband who had gone missing. On January 29, Pushpa Salvi received a call from an unknown number. The caller told her that her husband was found among the homeless people who were taken out of the city last Friday. Anil Salvi (50), who is suffering mental health problems, left his home in the city last month. Pushpa, after being unable to find him, had lodged a missing personâs complaint with police. Last week, someone recognised her husband in the visuals of some homeless people who were dumped out of the city. âOn January 29, I got a call from someone that my husband was found following which I took a taxi to go there,â she said on Tuesday. âMy husband was lying down with other elderly persons,â she said. Pushpa said she first took her husband to a hospital where doctors gave him medicines, following which she brought him home.
