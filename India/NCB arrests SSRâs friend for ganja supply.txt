Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), probing the drug angle in actor Sushant Singh Rajputâs death, on Tuesday arrested Rajputâs friend and assistant director Rishikesh Pawar for supplying him ganja, reports Ahmed Ali. Pawar is the 30th accused to be arrested in the probe into two cases of prevalence of abuse of drugs in Bollywood and supply of drugs to Rajput. Pawar was picked up early on Tuesday and taken to NCB office. He will be produced in court on Wednesday. Last week, NCB opposed his bail application before Bombay high court as there was âstrong digital evidenceâ. Sources said Pawar supplied ganja to Rajput through his cook, Deepesh Sawant. NCB seized Pawarâs mobile and laptop and claimed it found evidence like WhatsApp chats between Sawant and Pawar, and other accused.
