ALAPPUZHA: Congress and CPM units in Kerala faced a piquant situation after their top functionaries took part in an RSS fund collection drive for the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The DCC sought an explanation from its vice-president TG Reghunatha Pillai after he inaugurated the fund collection in Pallippuram. âIn temple affairs, there is no role for politics. I cleared my stand with party leaders,â Pillai said. Also, DCC president M Liju alleged that the CPM branch secretary L Thankammal donated money for construction of the Ram temple. Meanwhile, Congressâ students-wing NSUI launched a campaign in Jaipur to collect money from students for the construction of Ram temple, claiming that BJP and ABVP have been âlootingâ people in the name of raising fund for the temple, reported PTI. Congress national treasurer Pawan Bansal, however, said he wasnât aware of such a move by NSUI.
