NEW DELHI: The government asked Sri Lanka to abide by its commitment to allow India and Japan to develop the east container terminal (ECT) of Colombo port. Reports from Colombo had said on Monday that Lanka had pulled out of the agreement signed earlier with India and Japan. âI would like to reiterate the expectation of Government of India for expeditious implementation of the trilateral Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) signed in May 2019 among the Governments of India, Japan and Sri Lanka for the development of ECT,â a spokesperson for Indian High Commission in Colombo said. The state-owned Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) had signed an MoU with India and Japan to develop the strategic ECT. However, the Sri Lankan government said on Monday that the ECT will be operated 100% by the SLPA. âThe commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka has been conveyed several times in the recent past, including at the leadership level. ...All sides should continue to abide by the existing understandings and commitment,â the Indian spokesman added. The Colombo port trade unions had opposed the proposal of investors from India and Japan buying 49% stake in the ECT and had demanded it remain fully owned by SLPA.
