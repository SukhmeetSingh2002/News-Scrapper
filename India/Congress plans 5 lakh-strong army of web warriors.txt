NEW DELHI: Anxious to expand its digital footprint to take on an entrenched BJP, Congress is set to recruit an army of five lakh web warriors with the idea of amplifying its message across social media platforms. Sources said Congress will soon launch a campaign âjoin Congress social mediaâ across India in what would be a large recruitment drive. The party will interview respondents out of which itâll pick five lakh people as volunteers. Of them, the partyâs social media department will appoint 50,000 office bearers at district, state and national level, while the other 4.5 lakh persons would form the network of Congress workers who will help push the party message with âcoherence and in one voiceâ. Congress appears to have woken up to the importance of social media after the corona pandemic and the ensuing lockdown forced the party indoors and to carry out its activities through YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. The 10-month-long experience has left the party leadership somewhat relieved that despite its weak social media presence as compared to the ruling BJP, it managed to regularly convey its message to people through âspeak up â campaigns. Now, it wants to build on that experience with an eye on future. âWe have realised that this is the best way to beef up our social media team nationally with penetration down to district level. There is a big section of population that wants to fight for Congress values and we are just tapping into that segment,â a Congress office-bearer said. These web warriors would also be given training in booth management and grassroots activities.
