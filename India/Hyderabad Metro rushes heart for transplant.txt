HYDERABAD: In a first such initiative in the county, an exclusive passenger train of the Hyderabad Metro was used to transport a live organ (heart) for a transplant in just 30 minutes to avoid peak traffic of the city. The live organ, harvested from a 45-year-old brain-dead man, was transported in a special train to cover a distance of 21km. A team of medical experts, led by Dr AGK Gokhale, travelled along with the organ. âConsidering the traffic in the city and the fact that the hospitals are on opposite ends of the city, we consulted Metro authorities for transportation. Short of helicopters, we thought this is the best option for a fast, uninterrupted commute,â Dr Gokhale of Apollo Hospitals said. Green channels are used for transporting lungs and heart on road or by air. Dr G Swarnlatha, in charge of Jeevandan programme, said that for a heart transplant, the time period available for transit and transplantation is only four hours. âThis is the very first time that an organ has been transported through the Metro rail in the country,â she said.
