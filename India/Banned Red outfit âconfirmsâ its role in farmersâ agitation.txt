NAGPUR: The banned CPI (Maoist) has issued multiple official statements appearing to confirm law enforcement agenciesâ suspicion of âMaoist infiltrationâ into the ongoing farm agitation. Likening the new farm laws to the infamous British-era Rowlatt Act, the outfit has directed its frontal organisations to continue fighting alongside the farmer fraternity. In a January 30 statement attributed to CPI (Maoist)âs central committee spokesperson Abhay, the outfit accused the Centre of âdilly-dallyingâ on the demands of the farmers and trying to engineer a rift among those spearheading the stir. Womenâs wing functionary Ranita Hichhami, too, issued a statement committing her unitâs support to âfarmer brothers and sistersâ. The authenticity of this and other press releases attributed to CPI (Maoist) is being verified, sources said. The prospect of the Maoist think tank being fully involved in the agitation is, meanwhile, keeping security and intelligence agencies on their toes. The agencies are now keeping tabs on the movement of outfits such as the Peopleâs Liberation Guerrilla Army and the Revolutionary Peopleâs Committees.
