NEW DELHI: The Indian Newspaper Society on Tuesday condemned last weekâs FIRs against senior journalists and editors for âreporting on the farmersâ protestsâ. âOn behalf of the entire Print Media Industry, INS condemns the action taken by the Delhi, UP and MP Police in filing FIRs against senior editors and journalists for reporting on the farmersâ protest,â said INS president L Adimoolam. The INS also appealed to the governments of UP and MP to revisit their decisions âso that the rights of the Press are not circumscribed, and the media is able to perform its tasks, fearlessly,â a statement issued by INS said. Last week, the sedition charges slapped against senior editors and journalist had also drawn sharp condemnation from the Editors Guild of India and the Indian Womenâs Press Corps, with both journalist bodies describing the actions as efforts to âintimidate, harass, browbeat, and stifle the mediaâ.
