NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Tuesday told the Lok Sabha that NCRB does not maintain any specific data on arrests and/or detention of âcivil rights activistsâ or journalists. Asked if cases of detention/arrest of civil rights activities for peaceful dissent were on the rise, MoS(home) G Kishan Reddy said in the absence of NCRB data, âmaking any inference regarding trend of arrest and/or detention in this regard is not possibleâ. He added that there are adequate safeguards available under the Constitution of India and various statutes including the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, for ensuring protection of human rights. On another query seeking details on numbers of journalists arrested under IPC, Epidemic Diseases Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, MoS(Home) Nityanand Rai said âpoliceâ and âpublic orderâ being State subjects, it were the state governments that were responsible for prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of offences under these Acts. He added that NCRB does not maintain specific data on arrests of journalists. The government also underlined that it attaches highest importance to the safety and security of all residents including journalists. It said the MHA has issued advisories to states and UTs to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into own hand is punished promptly, as per law. At the same time, Rai cited an MHA advisory issued in October 2017 specifically asking states to enforce the law strictly to ensure safety and security of mediapersons.
