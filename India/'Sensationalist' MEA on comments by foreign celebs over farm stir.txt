NEW DELHI: The MEA on Wednesday condemned the remarks by foreign celebrities and entities over the farmers protest in India, calling the incident "unfortunate" and "sensationalist." In a stern statement, the government warned against the "temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments" and said the protests were by "a very small section of farmers" in parts of India. The statement comes after singer Rihanna, environment activist Greta Thunberg and a slew of foreign voices took to social media to express their"solidarity" with the farmers in the ongoing protest over the new farm laws. Earlier today, US Vice President Kamala Harris' niece Meena Harris too tweeted in support of the protests. It's unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, & derail them.

This was egregiously witnessed on January 26." The government said the Parliament of India after full debate and discussion, passed "reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector" and the reforms "give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers." In its statement, which included hashtags such as #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda, the government said that in order to end the deadlock, Centre and farmers union representatives have held 11 rounds of talks and also agreed to hold the implementation of the laws for 1 to 1.5 years. Complete coverage: Farmers' protest The government asserted that the police had handled the protests with "utmost restraint". "It may be noted that hundreds of men and women serving in the police have been physically attacked, and in some cases stabbed and seriously wounded," the statement read. The government, in an appeal, urged to exercise caution "before rushing to comment on such matters" and "ascertain facts for proper understanding of issues at hand." It further emphasised that these protests must be seen in the context of Indiaâs democratic ethos and polity, and the efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse. The farmers' tractor rally, called by farm unions on Jan 26 to highlight their demands against the repeal of the new farm laws, turned violent as thousands of protesters broke through barricades and clashed with the police. Many protesters resorted to vandalism, with few even hoisting religious flags on its domes and the flagstaff at the ramparts of Red Fort.
