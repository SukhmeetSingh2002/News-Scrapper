Budget: Canât depreciate goodwill

MUMBAI: The Finance Bill, 2021 has held that goodwill of a business will not be considered as a depreciable asset, in any situation. In laymanâs terms, in case of an acquisition, the price paid over and above the book value of the target company is towards âgoodwillâ. The acquiring company obtained a tax benefit as goodwill could be depreciated over a period of time, thus reducing the taxable income and liability. âThe amendment seeks to overcome judgments of multiple courts, including the Supreme Court in the case of Smiff Securities, which had held that depreciation could be claimed on goodwill for tax purposes. This impacts not just internal group restructurings but also business acquisitions,â said Hitesh Gajaria, senior partner at KPMG India.
