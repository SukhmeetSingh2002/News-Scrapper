NEW DELHI: The Budget for 2021-22 represents a comprehensive effort by the government to shore up the countryâs nascent economic recovery, global ratings agency S&P said on Tuesday, asserting that the aggressive provisioning to help the economy will be costly. âWhile we currently see no material effect from the Budget on Indiaâs key credit factors, the economyâs brightening growth prospects will be critical to maintaining the sustainability of public finances, with general government debt likely to hover at more than 90% of GDP over the next few years,â S&P said. It said it will take a long time for the economy to heal from the pandemic. It said the Budgetâs emphasis on capital expenditure marks a noteworthy shift, and higher investment in Indiaâs physical infrastructure should help to raise investment potential and competitiveness in the economy over time. The agency said the Indian central governmentâs reported shortfall of 9.5% of GDP in FY21 was bigger than expected, and the general government shortfall is highly likely to exceed its previous forecast of 12.5% of GDP this year. Prospects for disinvestment should be much stronger in the next financial year, and the governmentâs second attempt at listing LIC will likely be pivotal to its success, the agency said.
