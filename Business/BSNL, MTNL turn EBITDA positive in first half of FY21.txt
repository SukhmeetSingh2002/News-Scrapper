NEW DELHI: State-owned telcos BSNL and MTNL turned EBITDA positive in the first half of 2020-21, demonstrating a marked improvement in performance within a year of approval of their revival plan, the communications ministry said on Monday. While EBITDA of Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) rose to Rs 602 crore during the first half of 2020-2021, that of MTNL stood at Rs 276 crore, it said in a release. Both organisations expect to reduce their losses by 50% when compared to 2019-20, it said. Regarding 4G services, the department of telecom (DoT) has made its position clear that core network for 4G will be âtotally made in Indiaâ. BSNL and MTNL are strategic assets, and will provide a big impetus to Indian manufacturers in the field of telecom. BSNL is once again back on the track of profitability, it added. The improvement in performance came on the back of a sharp reduction in wage bill due to Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS).
