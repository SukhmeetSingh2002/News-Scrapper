Use of share exchange for rejigs faces tax

MUMBAI: Several high-value restructuring transactions that had taken place via exchange of shares, rather than a monetary consideration, escaped capital gains tax. Backed by judicial precedents, the corporate entities were able to successfully argue that these were a âslump-exchangeâ and not a slum sale, so do not attract the tax. A slump sale refers to transfer of an undertaking for a lump sum consideration, without assigning any values to the individual assets and liabilities that would be transferred. Additionally, a slump sale attracts capital gains tax. âCourts had previously held that only a âsaleâ of a business undertaking was taxable, and that an âexchangeâ of an undertaking for any other non-monetary assets could not be taxed. Budget overturns this,â said Hitesh Gajaria, senior partner at KPMG India. Gajaria explains that this proposed amendment will be effective from the financial year 2020-21.
