NEW DELHI: The fineprint of the finance bill usually leaves taxpayers wondering whatâs in store. Times of India â EY Guide decodes how salaried employees can save more of their salary from the taxmen. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday announced the Union Budget for 2021-22. While the government has kept the tax slabs unchanged, taxpayers will have some relief in dealing with their personal finances. However, the same does not come without caveats. Here's a list of personal income tax 'checks' all of you should watch out for--  Relief from income-tax return filing for senior citizens (aged 75 or more) will not be available if the individual has more than one bank account or has income other than pension and bank interest. Gap of up to 20% between stamp duty value and sale consideration is only allowed for first-time allotment of residential unit between November 12, 2020 and June 30, 2021. For all other cases (such as purchase of house from an existing owner), the current limit of 10% in variation will continue to apply. LTC cash scheme is only applicable for the financial year 2020-21. No tax benefit on LTC is available for goods or services purchased after April 1, 2021. There is lack of clarity on whether EPF interest will be taxable even where the employeeâs contribution exceeding 2.5 lakh was made before April 1, 2021 but the interest accrues on such past contributions after April 1, 2021.
