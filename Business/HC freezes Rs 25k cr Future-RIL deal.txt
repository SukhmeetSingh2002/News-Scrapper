BENGALURU: In a relief to Amazon, the Delhi high court on Tuesday said it is of the âclear viewâ that the emergency award (EA) by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) is enforceable in India. It has asked Future Group not to proceed with the Rs 24,731-crore deal with Reliance Industries (RIL) till it pronounces a final order. The court said it is âsatisfied that immediate orders are necessary to protect the rights of the petitioner (Amazon)â. The EA had stayed the Future-RIL deal in October 2020. Last week, Amazon moved the Delhi HC to enforce the EA and stop Future from taking any steps to close the deal with RIL. âAll the concerned authorities are directed to maintain status quo with respect to all matters in violation of the order dated October 25, 2020, and shall file the status report with respect to the present status within 10 days of the receipt of this order,â said the order by Justice J R Midha. During the court proceedings, Amazon had said it was open to hold a discussion to resolve the ongoing dispute, but Future said it wasnât keen on any such talks. Previously, Future too had approached the HC to stop Amazon from writing to regulators citing the SIAC order, but the court did not grant the injunction and said Amazon was free to write to regulators. âWe appreciate the interim order of the HC to uphold the enforceability of the EAâs order and maintain status quo,â a spokesperson of Amazon India said. A Future Group spokesperson said, âThe company will explore all legal remedies and take appropriate steps to pursue the scheme of arrangement.â
