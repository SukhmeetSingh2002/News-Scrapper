# News Scrapper
This is my first repo made using python.

[india]:https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india
[business]:https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business
[world]:https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world

It scrapes the all the news of [India][india],[World][world] and [Business][business] pages of [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com) (except some which require TOI subscription) and stores the news in different folders for different pages(works only on windows).
